DefaultResourceGroups
=====================

###Use Case

You have a MODX site, and you're using Resource Groups to control editing/viewing/etc of certain Resources. However, your site has a LOT of Resources. Will you define the Resource Group for each Resource manually? No! You will set DefaultResourceGroups (see what we did there?) for each context, and watch the magic happen!
